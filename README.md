## 🔎 Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization  
   - Stopword & punctuation removal  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Normalization (lowercasing, stemming)  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Sentiment distribution  
   - Word clouds, histograms  
   - Trends by location, platform, rating  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Text vectorization (TF-IDF, embeddings, BERT)  
   - Classification using ML/DL models  
   - Performance evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  

4. **Deployment & Visualization**  
   - Streamlit dashboard for sentiment insights  
   - Visualizations: word clouds, line charts, bar plots, heatmaps
